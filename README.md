# Fetch Receipt Date
This project is completely based on data extraction and filtration. 
Expense date (also called spend date) is the exact date on which a financial transaction or operation has happened and must be recognized in the accounting system. 
The format of expense dates vary across merchants and the country of issue. In a few cases, the expense date may not be present in the receipt. 
Our objective here is to convert the image to text, and separate the date.   
To achieve this we need to install a module called Tesseract which is used to convert image to text. 
Go through my program to see how this works. 
Please feel free to ask if you have any doubt. All comments are welcome!
